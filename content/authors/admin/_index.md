    #      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Peter Okelmann is a PhD candidate with the [Systems Research Group](https://dos.cit.tum.de) at Technical University Munich.
His research interests include virtualization with containers or virtual machines, often at their intersection with networking.
Aside from his research, he sometimes contributes to [NixOS](https://nixos.org) as a maintainer.

In the past, he interned at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/), advised by [Istemi Ekin Akkus](https://iakkus.github.io/) and [Riuchuan Chen](https://www.ruichuan.org/), where he addressed the I/O performance gap imposed by hardware confidentiality onto virtual machines.
